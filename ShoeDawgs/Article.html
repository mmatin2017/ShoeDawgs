      <h2>The Nike Air Jordan 1</h2>
  <p>Air Jordan, His Airness, The GOAT, MJ, Mike, Michael Jordan. We all know
    who he is, and his tremendous accomplishments on the court, but his impact
     off the court and in the world of business is what truly separates him and
     from the pack. Michael Jordan’s impact on “street culture” and the shoe
     industry is unparalleled and the legacy that he’s created will live on well
     into the future. </p><br/>
     <p>The Air Jordan 1 is arguably the most iconic shoe in sneaker history.
       35 years after the initial release, the silhouette is still one of the
       most sought after in the sneakerhead community. No matter if the shoe is
        in limited quantity or for general release, the hype for these shoes are
         always there, making them harder to obtain than the average sneaker. In
          the resale market, depending on the colorway the shoe will often times
           sell for more than what it was retailed for, sometimes even selling
           for well over a thousand dollars. The countless colorways give the
           average consumer a variety to choose from in their liking and the many
            different collaborations adds to the hype for the more avid sneakerhead.
            This has led to the Air Jordan 1 being appreciated by millions
             throughout the years. </p><br/>
             <p>Nike was not Michael Jordan’s first choice for a shoe endorsement.
                Instead, he was more interested in signing a deal with Adidas or
                Converse. However, Adidas were not attentive at the time to sign
                a young Michael Jordan due to the passing away the founder of the
                company, Adi Dassler. Furthermore, Converse had overlooked Michael
                 as they had shoe deals with Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.
                 The reason he was not keen on signing with Nike as he felt that
                  he had no court feel in the shoes that Nike had at the time.
                  However, the company aggressively pursued the youngster, and
                  offered a new shoe tailored just for him. Having a tailored
                  shoe along with the large contract that Nike was providing
                  sealed the deal, thus leading to the creation of the most
                  iconic shoe in sneaker culture.</p><br/>
